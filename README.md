# ImageCartoonizer
ImageCartoonizer is a Python script that converts images into cartoon-like versions using various image processing techniques.

## Prerequisites
Before running this script, you need to make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

• Python 3.x

• cv2 (OpenCV) library

• numpy library

• tkinter library

• Pillow library (a fork of PIL)

You can install these dependencies using pip by running the following command:
```pip install opencv-python numpy tkinter pillow```

## Running the Script
Save the script in a Python file with a .py extension (e.g., image_to_cartoon.py), and run it using the Python interpreter:
```python image_to_cartoon.py```

A GUI window will appear with an "Open Image" button. Click the button to select an image file. The script will convert the image to a cartoon-like version and display it in the window.

## Acknowledgements
The code in this repository is inspired by various image processing techniques and examples available in the OpenCV documentation and tutorials.
